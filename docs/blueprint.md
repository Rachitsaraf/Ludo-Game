- Primary color: Light pastel blue (#A7D9ED) to evoke a playful and calming atmosphere suitable for children.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). This creates a soft and non-distracting backdrop for the game elements.
- Accent color: Soft pastel green (#C1FFC1), which is analogous to blue, offering a contrasting yet harmonious highlight for interactive elements and notifications.
- Font: 'Baloo', sans-serif, known for being child-like. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use vector illustrations for themes and balloon tokens to maintain scalability and visual appeal.
- Use rounded corners for all buttons, popups, dice, and tokens to provide a friendly and approachable interface.
- Incorporate animations for dice rolls, balloon movement, popup transitions, and button taps using ripple or bounce effects.
